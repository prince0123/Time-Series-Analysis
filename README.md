### Time Series Analysis of Historical Stock Prices

#### Project Description

Embark on an analytical journey through the historical stock prices dataset, focusing on the intricate patterns, trends, and insights hidden within the temporal data. This time series analysis project aims to delve deep into the fluctuations and movements of stock prices over a specified period. By leveraging various analytical techniques and statistical methods, the goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of how stock prices evolve over time and what factors influence their behavior.

#### Objectives

1. **Uncover Patterns and Trends**:
   - Identify seasonal effects, cyclical patterns, and long-term trends in stock price movements.
   - Use visualization techniques to highlight significant patterns in the temporal data.

2. **Analyze Volatility**:
   - Measure the volatility of stock prices over different time intervals.
   - Investigate periods of high and low volatility to understand market dynamics.

3. **Forecast Future Prices**:
   - Apply predictive models to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.
   - Evaluate the accuracy of different forecasting methods.

4. **Understand Influencing Factors**:
   - Examine the impact of external factors, such as economic indicators, political events, and market sentiment, on stock price movements.
   - Correlate stock price changes with major news events and market announcements.

5. **Gain Insights for Investment Strategies**:
   - Derive actionable insights that can inform investment decisions.
   - Develop strategies based on identified trends and predicted movements.

#### Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Collect historical stock price data from reliable financial sources.
   - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conduct EDA to summarize main characteristics and visualize the data.
   - Use line plots, histograms, and heatmaps to explore temporal relationships.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Analyze the relationships between different stock prices and market indicators.
   - Use correlation matrices to identify significant correlations.

4. **Time Series Decomposition**:
   - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
   - Analyze each component separately to understand its contribution to the overall pattern.

5. **Rolling Statistics**:
   - Calculate rolling statistics to understand the moving averages and volatility over time.
   - Use rolling mean and rolling standard deviation to detect trends and variability.

6. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:
   - Apply MACD to identify changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend.
   - Use MACD to generate buy and sell signals.

7. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:
   - Use RSI to measure the speed and change of price movements.
   - Identify overbought or oversold conditions in the stock market.

8. **Stationarity Testing**:
   - Test for stationarity using methods like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
   - Ensure the data is stationary for accurate time series modeling.

9. **Modeling & Model Evaluation**:
   - Use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for modeling and forecasting.
   - Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

10. **Forecasting**:
    - Forecast future stock prices using the trained LSTM model.
    - Compare forecasts with actual values to assess accuracy.

#### Expected Outcomes

- Identification of key patterns and trends in historical stock prices.
- Improved understanding of factors influencing stock price movements.
- Reliable forecasts of future stock prices based on historical data.
- Practical insights that can be used to enhance investment strategies and decision-making.
